        <h2>The Daughter of Evil (novel)</h2>
       
        <p>"To protect you... for that, I will even become evil!"</p>
  <p>The major power of the Evillious region, the Kingdom of Lucifenia, was ruled by the 14-year-old princess Riliane, who wielded her absolute power ruthlessly, executing those who defied her. Allen, Riliane's servant, was actually her younger twin brother, who had feigned his death. As the kingdom descended into chaos, a revolution led by the "swordswoman in red armor," Allen's foster sister Germaine, sought to overthrow Riliane's tyranny.</p>
  <p>The plot unfolds with Allen caught between loyalty to his sister and a growing affection for Michaela, a servant of the merchant Keel Freezis. As political intrigue and revolution grip Lucifenia, Allen is faced with increasingly difficult choices, ultimately leading to a dramatic climax where secrets are revealed, alliances are tested, and justice is served.</p>
